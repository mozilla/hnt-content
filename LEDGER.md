# Decisions log

Running log of non-obvious implementation decisions for the Article Crawler
(HNT-2086). One entry per decision, newest last, with its rationale. See the
tech spec (referenced in CLAUDE.local.md) for the design these decisions
implement.

## HNT-2086: integration branch baseline

The integration branch `claude/hnt-2086-crawling-pipeline-v2` already carries
the merged Milestone 1-4 work plus Sentry (HNT-2589) and the article worker
wired to Pub/Sub (HNT-2113). Remaining buildable work is Milestones 5-8 minus
the deploy, shadow-mode, and cutover tasks, which are human-gated. The build
order respects milestone numbering and dependencies: 5.9, then 6.1 and 6.2,
then 7.1 through 7.3, then 8.1, 8.2, and 8.4, with StatsD metrics (5.8) last
because it instruments code the earlier tasks build.
